  ################# trick to use less data #################
  # If you are unable to train all images on your machine,
  # you can reduce training data by randomly sampling n 
  # images from the total list.
  # Keep decreasing the value of n from len(imageNames) to
  # a value which works on your machine.
  # Uncomment the next two lines to decrease training data
  # n = 1000
  # imageNames = random.sample(imageNames, n)
